# happy-discord-bot
## Inspiration
I saw the idea of making Discord bot in MLH-GHW December Challenges, it got my mind and I wanted to do something cool.
## What it does
HappyBot is a Discord bot it sends happy/positive message in channel when some server user types sad/negative words. It also sends random inspirational quote on command.
Features: 
- User can turn of bot responding directly from Discord
- Users can view/add/delete responding happy messages from Discord itself.

## How I built it
I made this bot with help of FreeCodeCamp tutorial then I made changes in data, like I made the sad words repository bigger by adding more words which I took from [link](https://github.com/shekhargulati/sentiment-analysis-python/blob/master/opinion-lexicon-English/negative-words.txt).
## Challenges I ran into
I don't work with Python often so I got many errors while developing it.
## What I learned
Major learning I took away from this project was **how to make Discord Bot** and I also learned more about **Python and it's libraries such as json and requests**.
## What's next for Happy Discord Bot
Currently nothing planned for future of Happy Bot.
